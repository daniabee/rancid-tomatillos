### Abstract
Our team created a movie review site utilizing an API that presented us with with an array of movies and details. The user is able to search and filter by genre or title, and when a specific movie is clicked, the user will be presented a page with additional details regarding the movie's rating, release date, revenue, and several other details. 

This project took place during the third inning of Turing's front-end software engineering program, and required us to utilize our newly learned skills in react to create a fully functioning site from design to operation in just under 2 weeks. As a team we utilized our project management and research skills to ensure we had the time and knowledge to complete this application.
